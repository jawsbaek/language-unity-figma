# Epic 4: Reporting (MVP)

## Epic Goal
Enable comprehensive reporting capabilities that allow users to export issue data in multiple formats for auditing, compliance tracking, and workflow integration while maintaining a complete issue lifecycle management system.

## Epic Description
This epic implements the reporting and data export functionality that transforms the plugin from a standalone tool into part of a broader content governance workflow. Users can export detailed reports in multiple formats, track issue status over time, and integrate findings with external systems for compliance and quality assurance purposes.

## Business Value
- Enables compliance auditing and quality tracking
- Supports integration with external workflow systems
- Provides historical tracking of language consistency efforts
- Facilitates team reporting and management oversight

## User Stories

### S4.1: CSV Export with Comprehensive Fields
**As a** Brand Manager or Team Lead  
**I want to** export issues to CSV format with detailed metadata  
**So that** I can analyze language consistency trends and create compliance reports

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CSV export includes: page name, node ID, rule ID, severity, original text, suggested fix, status
- User can select which fields to include in the export
- Export handles special characters and text formatting correctly
- Large datasets are exported efficiently without UI blocking
- File naming includes timestamp and scope information

**Definition of Done:**
- CSV generation functionality implemented
- Field selection UI complete
- Character encoding and formatting handled
- Performance optimized for large exports
- File naming and download system working

### S4.2: JSON Export for Automation Integration
**As a** Developer or Automation Engineer  
**I want to** export issue data in JSON format with full metadata  
**So that** I can integrate findings with automated workflows and systems

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JSON export includes complete issue metadata and rule information
- Export structure is well-documented and consistent
- Nested data (rule details, node references) is properly structured
- Export supports both current state and historical data
- API-friendly format for programmatic consumption

**Definition of Done:**
- JSON export functionality implemented
- Schema documentation complete
- Metadata completeness verified
- Integration testing with sample automation scripts
- Performance benchmarks met

### S4.3: Issue Status Lifecycle Management
**As a** Plugin System  
**I want to** track and maintain issue status throughout the workflow  
**So that** reports accurately reflect the current state and history of identified issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Issue status progresses: Open â†’ Fixed/Ignored with timestamps
- Status changes are reflected in all reports immediately
- Historical status information is preserved for trending
- Status changes trigger appropriate UI updates
- Bulk status changes are supported and tracked

**Definition of Done:**
- Status lifecycle system implemented
- Timestamp tracking for all status changes
- Historical data preservation working
- UI updates for status changes complete
- Bulk operations status handling verified

## Technical Requirements

### Export System Architecture
- Modular export system supporting multiple formats
- Streaming export for large datasets
- Background processing to maintain UI responsiveness
- Robust error handling for export failures

### Data Structure Design
- Comprehensive issue metadata schema
- Efficient data serialization
- Support for nested and complex data types
- Version-compatible export formats

### Status Management
- Persistent status tracking across sessions
- Atomic status update operations
- Historical data retention policies
- Efficient status query and filtering

### Performance Considerations
- Streaming export for large datasets (>10k issues)
- Progress indication for long-running exports
- Memory-efficient data processing
- Cancellable export operations

## Dependencies
- Epic 2: Scan & Issue Surfacing (for issue data)
- Epic 3: Fix Application & Undo (for status updates)
- File system access for export functionality

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Large export files causing memory issues
  - **Mitigation**: Implement streaming export with chunked processing
- **Risk**: Data consistency during concurrent operations
  - **Mitigation**: Atomic status updates and proper data locking
- **Risk**: Export format compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing with various data import tools

## Success Metrics
- Export completion success rate > 98%
- Export generation time for typical datasets
- User adoption of reporting features
- Integration success with external tools

## Definition of Epic Done
- All 3 user stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- Both CSV and JSON export formats working reliably
- Issue lifecycle tracking complete and accurate
- Performance targets met for large datasets
- Integration testing with common reporting tools complete
