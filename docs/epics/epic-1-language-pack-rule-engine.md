# Epic 1: Language Pack & Rule Engine (MVP)

## Epic Goal
Enable the Figma plugin to load, validate, and cache company language packs while providing a robust rule evaluation engine that can process terminology, style, and regex-based rules with configurable severity levels.

## Epic Description
This epic establishes the foundational capabilities for the language consistency plugin by implementing the core language pack management and rule evaluation systems. Users will be able to load language packs from local files or URLs, have them validated and cached locally, and leverage a powerful rule engine that can evaluate string matching, aliases, forbidden terms, and regex-based style rules.

## Business Value
- Enables consistent terminology enforcement across design teams
- Provides flexible rule configuration to match company style guides
- Ensures offline-first operation with optional remote sync capabilities
- Establishes foundation for all subsequent plugin functionality

## User Stories

### S1.1: Load Language Pack from Local File
**As a** Designer or UX Writer  
**I want to** load a language pack from a local JSON/YAML file  
**So that** I can use my company's terminology and style rules in Figma

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can select a local JSON/YAML file via file picker
- Plugin validates the file against the language pack schema
- Valid language packs are cached in figma.clientStorage
- Invalid files show clear error messages with validation details
- Cached packs persist between plugin sessions

**Definition of Done:**
- File picker integration implemented
- JSON/YAML schema validation working
- Local storage caching functional
- Error handling for invalid files
- Unit tests for validation logic

### S1.2: Load Language Pack from URL
**As a** Team Lead or Brand Manager  
**I want to** load language packs from a centralized URL  
**So that** my team can stay synchronized with the latest terminology updates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can input a URL to fetch language pack (opt-in network access)
- Plugin validates checksum/signature when provided in the pack
- Network failures are handled gracefully with clear error messages
- CORS and security restrictions are properly managed
- Remote packs are cached locally after successful fetch

**Definition of Done:**
- URL input and fetch functionality implemented
- Checksum/signature validation working
- Network error handling complete
- Security considerations addressed
- Integration tests for remote fetch

---

### S1.3: Rule Evaluation Engine
**As a** Plugin System  
**I want to** evaluate text content against loaded language pack rules  
**So that** I can identify terminology and style violations accurately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Engine supports string matching (preferred/aliases/forbidden terms)
- Regex-based style rules are properly evaluated
- Severity levels (error/warning/info) are respected
- Rule evaluation is performant for typical text volumes
- Multiple rule types can be applied to the same text

**Definition of Done:**
- String matching engine implemented
- Regex rule evaluation working
- Severity level handling complete
- Performance benchmarks met (< 100ms for typical text)
- Comprehensive unit test coverage

---

### S1.4: Settings UI for Configuration
**As a** User  
**I want to** configure plugin settings for scope, locale, and severity filters  
**So that** I can customize the plugin behavior to match my workflow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Settings panel allows scope selection (selection/page/file)
- Locale selection from available language packs
- Severity filter controls (error/warning/info)
- Settings persist per file via figma.clientStorage
- Clear UI for all configuration options

**Definition of Done:**
- Settings UI components implemented
- Persistence mechanism working
- All configuration options functional
- UI/UX follows Figma plugin guidelines
- Settings validation and error handling

## Technical Requirements

### Language Pack Schema Support
- JSON and YAML format support
- Schema validation with clear error reporting
- Version tracking and compatibility checking
- Checksum/signature verification for remote packs

### Rule Engine Architecture
- Modular rule evaluation system
- Support for multiple rule types (string, regex, composite)
- Configurable severity levels
- Efficient text processing algorithms

### Storage and Caching
- figma.clientStorage integration for local caching
- Version-aware cache invalidation
- Secure storage of sensitive configuration

### Performance Requirements
- Language pack loading < 1s for typical files (< 1MB)
- Rule evaluation < 100ms for text blocks (< 10KB)
- Memory usage < 50MB for loaded packs
- Graceful handling of large language packs

## Dependencies
- Figma Plugin API for file picker and storage
- JSON/YAML parsing libraries
- Schema validation library
- Network fetch capabilities (optional)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Large language packs causing performance issues
  - **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading and rule indexing
- **Risk**: Schema validation complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Use established JSON Schema validation libraries
- **Risk**: Network security concerns
  - **Mitigation**: Implement proper CORS handling and content validation

## Success Metrics
- Language pack loading success rate > 95%
- Rule evaluation performance meets targets
- User adoption of settings customization
- Cache hit rate for repeated plugin usage

## Definition of Epic Done
- All 4 user stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- Performance benchmarks achieved
- Security requirements satisfied
- Integration tests passing
- Documentation complete for language pack format and API
