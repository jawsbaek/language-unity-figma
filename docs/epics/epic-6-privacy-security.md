# Epic 6: Privacy & Security (MVP)

## Epic Goal
Implement comprehensive privacy and security measures that protect user design content while enabling secure language pack distribution and maintaining compliance with data protection requirements.

## Epic Description
This epic addresses the critical privacy and security requirements for a plugin that processes potentially sensitive design content. It establishes a privacy-first approach where design text remains on-device by default, implements secure remote pack fetching with proper validation, and provides transparency about data handling practices.

## Business Value
- Builds user trust through transparent privacy practices
- Enables enterprise adoption through security compliance
- Protects sensitive design content and intellectual property
- Provides secure foundation for team collaboration features

## User Stories

### S6.1: Default Privacy with Offline-First Operation
**As a** Designer working with sensitive content  
**I want to** ensure my design text never leaves my device by default  
**So that** I can use the plugin while maintaining confidentiality and compliance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All text processing happens locally on the user's device
- No design content is transmitted over network by default
- Privacy behavior is clearly documented in the UI
- User receives explicit confirmation before any network operations
- Offline operation is fully functional without network access

**Definition of Done:**
- Local-only processing architecture implemented
- Privacy documentation in UI complete
- Network operation confirmations working
- Offline functionality verified
- Privacy compliance review completed

### S6.2: Secure Remote Pack Fetching with Opt-in
**As a** Team Lead managing centralized language packs  
**I want to** securely distribute updated language packs to my team  
**So that** we can maintain consistency while protecting against malicious content

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Remote fetch requires explicit user opt-in with clear privacy notice
- CORS and network failures are handled gracefully
- SSL/HTTPS is enforced for all remote pack fetching
- Network errors provide helpful troubleshooting information
- Fallback to cached versions when remote fetch fails

**Definition of Done:**
- Opt-in flow with privacy notice implemented
- HTTPS enforcement and CORS handling complete
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms working
- Network troubleshooting guidance available
- Security testing of remote fetch completed

### S6.3: Language Pack Validation and Integrity
**As a** Security-conscious user  
**I want to** verify the authenticity and integrity of language packs  
**So that** I can trust the content and rules being applied to my designs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JSON schema validation for all language packs
- Optional checksum verification when provided in packs
- Optional signature validation for trusted pack sources
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Malformed or suspicious packs are rejected safely

**Definition of Done:**
- JSON schema validation implemented
- Checksum verification working when available
- Signature validation system complete
- Validation error handling comprehensive
- Security testing against malicious packs completed

## Technical Requirements

### Privacy Architecture
- Local-only text processing by default
- No telemetry or analytics without explicit consent
- Secure local storage of sensitive settings
- Clear data handling documentation

### Security Framework
- Input validation for all external data
- Secure network communications (HTTPS only)
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Protection against injection attacks

### Validation Systems
- Comprehensive JSON schema validation
- Cryptographic checksum verification
- Digital signature validation framework
- Malicious content detection and prevention

### Compliance Features
- Privacy policy integration
- Data handling transparency
- User consent management
- Audit trail for security events

## Dependencies
- Epic 1: Language Pack & Rule Engine (for pack loading)
- Cryptographic libraries for checksum/signature validation
- Network security APIs and HTTPS enforcement

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Privacy policy changes affecting user trust
  - **Mitigation**: Clear communication and granular consent options
- **Risk**: Network security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Security audit and penetration testing
- **Risk**: Validation bypass or circumvention
  - **Mitigation**: Defense-in-depth validation approach

## Security Considerations
- **Network Security**: HTTPS enforcement, certificate validation
- **Content Validation**: Schema validation, checksum verification
- **Input Sanitization**: Protection against malicious pack content
- **Storage Security**: Secure local storage of sensitive data

## Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR**: Data processing transparency and user consent
- **Enterprise Security**: Audit trails and security logging
- **Industry Standards**: Following security best practices

## Success Metrics
- Zero data breaches or privacy incidents
- User trust scores and feedback on privacy features
- Security validation pass rates
- Compliance audit results

## Definition of Epic Done
- All 3 user stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- Privacy-first operation verified and documented
- Security validation systems working correctly
- Compliance requirements satisfied
- Security audit and penetration testing completed successfully
