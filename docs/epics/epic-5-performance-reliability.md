# Epic 5: Performance & Reliability (MVP)

## Epic Goal
Ensure the plugin performs efficiently with large files and datasets while providing robust error handling and maintaining system reliability under various usage conditions.

## Epic Description
This epic focuses on the non-functional requirements that make the plugin suitable for production use in professional design environments. It addresses performance optimization for large files, scalability for extensive issue lists, and comprehensive error handling that maintains user confidence and system stability.

## Business Value
- Enables plugin use with large, complex design files
- Provides reliable operation in professional workflows
- Maintains user productivity through consistent performance
- Reduces support burden through robust error handling

## User Stories

### S5.1: Streamed Traversal with Performance Targets
**As a** User working with large files  
**I want to** scan pages with many TEXT nodes without UI freezing  
**So that** I can maintain productivity while processing complex designs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Page scans complete in < 2 seconds for typical files (â‰¤5k TEXT nodes)
- Traversal yields to main thread to prevent UI blocking
- Progress indication shows scan completion status
- Memory usage remains stable during large file processing
- System remains responsive to user input during scans

**Definition of Done:**
- Streaming traversal algorithm implemented
- Performance benchmarks met and verified
- Progress indication UI complete
- Memory usage profiled and optimized
- Responsiveness testing across various file sizes
