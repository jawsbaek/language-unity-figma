# Figma Language Consistency Plugin UI/UX Specification

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Figma Language Consistency Plugin's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

- **Professional Designers:** Need efficient validation during active design work with minimal learning curve
- **UX Writers:** Require comprehensive review tools with detailed context and batch capabilities
- **Localization/Brand Teams:** Need policy enforcement tools with audit trails and compliance reporting
- **International Teams:** Working across multiple locales with varying language expertise levels

### Usability Goals

- **Immediate feedback:** Issues highlighted in ≤ 2 seconds with visual severity indicators
- **Efficient resolution:** 80% of common fixes completable in ≤ 3 clicks with keyboard shortcuts available
- **Non-disruptive integration:** Plugin operates without interrupting design flow or requiring context switching
- **Progressive expertise:** Novice users get educational guidance, experts get streamlined workflows
- **Privacy transparency:** All data processing clearly explained with user control over sharing

### Design Principles

1. **Privacy by design** - Local processing with clear data handling transparency (Priority 1)
2. **Contextual clarity** - Issues shown with visual severity hierarchy and clear explanations (Priority 1)  
3. **Efficient triage** - Rapid decision-making through keyboard navigation and bulk operations (Priority 2)
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Educational details available but not required for expert users (Priority 2)
5. **Respectful workflow integration** - Highlight issues without overwhelming the canvas or disrupting flow (Priority 3)

```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Tab-based interface with four main sections: Issues (default), Rules, Settings, Reports. Tab badges show issue counts and status indicators.

**Secondary Navigation:** Within each tab, contextual filters and grouping options. Issues tab includes severity filters, page selectors, and search. Settings includes collapsible sections for different configuration types.

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Minimal breadcrumbs due to shallow hierarchy. Context maintained through tab state and selected filters. Issue detail views show "Back to Issues" with preserved filter state.

## User Flows

### Scan and Discovery Flow

**User Goal:** Quickly identify language consistency issues in current design work

**Entry Points:** 
- Plugin launch (default action)
- Manual scan trigger after text changes
- Auto-scan on typing (if enabled in settings)

**Success Criteria:** User sees comprehensive issue list with clear priorities and can understand scope of work needed

#### Flow Diagram

    A[Plugin Opens] --> B{Language Pack Loaded?}
    B -->|No| C[Show Pack Setup Prompt]
    B -->|Yes| D[Show Scan Options]

    G --> H[Display Results]
    H --> I[Issues List with Counts]
    H --> J[Canvas Highlights]
    I --> K{Issues Found?}

    K -->|No| M[Show Success State]
    
    L --> N[User Reviews Issues]
    N --> O[Select Issue for Details]
    O --> P[Issue Detail View]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- No language pack configured: Show setup wizard with sample pack option
- Scan timeout on large files: Show progress with cancel option, paginated results
- Network failure for URL pack: Fallback to cached pack with warning
- No text nodes found: Show informative empty state with scan scope tips
- Parsing errors in pack: Show validation errors with specific line numbers

**Notes:** The flow prioritizes getting users to results quickly while handling the complexity of pack management gracefully. Auto-scan is opt-in to avoid disrupting design flow.

### Fix and Resolution Flow

**User Goal:** Efficiently resolve language issues with confidence and ability to undo

**Entry Points:**
- Click on issue in list
- Click on canvas highlight
- Keyboard navigation through issues

**Success Criteria:** User can apply fixes individually or in bulk with clear feedback and full undo capability

#### Flow Diagram

    A[Issue Selected] --> B[Show Issue Detail]
    B --> C[Context Preview]
    C --> D[Show Fix Options]
    D --> E[Single Fix]

    N -->|No| B
    
    G --> P[Mark as Ignored]
    P --> Q[Update Issue List]
    
    H --> R[Add Rule Exception]
    R --> S[Update Allowlist]
    S --> Q
    
    K --> T[Show Success Feedback]
    O --> U[Show Bulk Success]
    T --> Q
    U --> Q
    
    Q --> V{More Issues?}
    V -->|Yes| W[Next Issue Available]
    V -->|No| X[Show Completion State]
    
    W --> Y[Auto-navigate or Stay]
    Y --> A
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Fix conflicts with other rules: Show warning with options to proceed or review
- Node deleted during fix process: Show error and refresh issue list
- Undo limit reached: Warn user before applying bulk changes
- Network interruption during pack sync: Allow offline fixes with sync on reconnect
- Invalid replacement text: Validate before applying and show specific error

**Notes:** The flow balances efficiency (bulk operations) with safety (preview and confirm). Keyboard shortcuts enable rapid triage for power users.

### Reporting and Export Flow

**User Goal:** Generate compliance reports and export issue data for team review or documentation

**Entry Points:**
- Reports tab in plugin
- Export button in issue list
- Scheduled export (future feature)

**Success Criteria:** User gets formatted report with all necessary context for stakeholder review and compliance tracking

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid

    A[Reports Tab Selected] --> B[Show Report Options]
    B --> C[Export Format Selection]
    C --> D[CSV for Spreadsheets]
    C --> E[JSON for Automation]
    C --> F[PDF for Stakeholders]
    
    D --> G[Configure CSV Options]
    E --> H[Configure JSON Structure]
    F --> I[Configure PDF Layout]
    
    G --> J[Select Data Fields]
    H --> J
    I --> J
    
    J --> K[Include Issue Details]
    J --> L[Include Rule Context]
    J --> M[Include Fix Status]
    J --> N[Include Metadata]
    
    K --> O[Generate Report]
    L --> O
    M --> O
    N --> O
    
    O --> P[Processing Indicator]
    P --> Q[Download Ready]
    Q --> R[Save to Downloads]
    
    R --> S[Show Success Message]
    S --> T[Option to Share/Email]
    T --> U[Open in Default App]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Large report generation timeout: Show progress with streaming download option
- File save permission denied: Offer alternative save locations or clipboard copy
- Empty report (no issues): Show informative message with scan suggestions
- Corrupted export data: Validate before download and show retry option
- Browser download blocked: Provide manual download link and instructions

**Notes:** The export flow accommodates different stakeholder needs (technical JSON, executive PDF, analyst CSV) while maintaining data integrity and providing clear status feedback.
