- Standard: Mixed mouse/touch optimization, keyboard shortcuts
- Wide: Mouse-optimized precision interactions, hover states
- Extra Wide: Advanced keyboard shortcuts, bulk operations UI

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

- **Purposeful motion** - Every animation serves a functional purpose (feedback, guidance, or context)
- **Respectful timing** - Quick enough to feel responsive (< 300ms), slow enough to be perceivable
- **Reduced motion support** - Honor user's prefers-reduced-motion settings with static alternatives
- **Performance first** - Use transform and opacity properties for smooth 60fps animations

### Key Animations

- **Issue scan progress**: Linear progress bar with pulse effect (Duration: Variable, Easing: ease-out)
- **Fix application feedback**: Scale + color transition for applied fixes (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Panel transitions**: Slide transitions between tabs and views (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Hover states**: Subtle scale and shadow changes (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens with shimmer effect (Duration: 1.5s loop, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Success confirmations**: Check mark draw-in animation (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Error indicators**: Gentle shake for invalid inputs (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Bulk operations**: Staggered animations for multiple item updates (Duration: 100ms per item, Easing: ease-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Plugin initialization < 500ms on average hardware
- **Interaction Response:** UI feedback within 100ms, operations complete within 2s
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and transitions

### Design Strategies

**Efficient Rendering:** Use virtual scrolling for large issue lists, lazy load non-critical components, implement skeleton screens for perceived performance

**Memory Management:** Limit concurrent canvas highlights to 50 items, implement pagination for large result sets, clean up event listeners and observers

**Network Optimization:** Cache language packs locally, use incremental loading for large rule sets, implement offline-first functionality

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Stakeholder Review** - Present specification to product team and gather feedback on UX approach
2. **Technical Validation** - Review feasibility of proposed interactions with development team
3. **Design System Setup** - Create Figma component library based on defined design system
4. **Prototype Creation** - Build interactive prototype for key user flows
5. **Accessibility Audit** - Validate color contrast and interaction patterns meet WCAG standards
