# Story 1.2: Load Language Pack from URL

## Status: Ready

## Story
**As a** Team Lead or Brand Manager  
**I want to** load language packs from a centralized URL  
**So that** my team can stay synchronized with the latest terminology updates

## Epic
Epic 1: Language Pack & Rule Engine (MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC2.1**: User can input a URL to fetch language pack (opt-in network access)
   - URL input field available in settings panel
   - Clear opt-in flow with privacy notice before first network request
   - Support for HTTPS URLs only

2. **AC2.2**: Plugin validates checksum/signature when provided in the pack
   - Checksum verification using SHA-256 or similar
   - Optional signature validation for trusted sources
   - Validation occurs after successful download

3. **AC2.3**: Network failures are handled gracefully with clear error messages
   - Timeout handling (30 second default)
   - Connection error messaging
   - HTTP error status code handling (404, 403, 500, etc.)

4. **AC2.4**: CORS and security restrictions are properly managed
   - Proper CORS header handling
   - SSL certificate validation
   - Protection against redirect attacks

5. **AC2.5**: Remote packs are cached locally after successful fetch
   - Downloaded packs stored in figma.clientStorage
   - Cache includes source URL and fetch timestamp
   - Option to refresh from remote source

## Priority
Medium - Important for team collaboration

## Effort Estimate
8 story points

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1: Local file loading (for caching system)
- Network access permissions in plugin manifest
- Cryptographic libraries for checksum validation

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design secure URL input UI
  - [ ] Create URL input field with validation
  - [ ] Implement privacy notice and opt-in flow
  - [ ] Add HTTPS-only validation

- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement network fetch functionality
  - [ ] Add fetch API integration with timeout
  - [ ] Handle various HTTP response codes
  - [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures

- [ ] **Task 3**: Build checksum validation system
  - [ ] Integrate cryptographic library (SHA-256)
  - [ ] Parse checksum from pack metadata
  - [ ] Validate downloaded content against checksum

- [ ] **Task 4**: Add signature validation (optional)
  - [ ] Design signature validation framework
  - [ ] Support common signature formats
  - [ ] Implement trusted source management

- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement comprehensive error handling
  - [ ] Network timeout and connection errors
  - [ ] HTTP status code error mapping
  - [ ] Security validation failures
  - [ ] User-friendly error message system

- [ ] **Task 6**: Extend caching system for remote packs
  - [ ] Store remote pack metadata (URL, timestamp)
  - [ ] Implement cache refresh functionality
  - [ ] Add cache invalidation options

- [ ] **Task 7**: Security and CORS handling
  - [ ] Implement CORS preflight handling
  - [ ] SSL certificate validation
  - [ ] Protection against malicious redirects

- [ ] **Task 8**: Add comprehensive testing
  - [ ] Unit tests for network functionality
  - [ ] Integration tests with mock servers
  - [ ] Security testing with malicious inputs
  - [ ] Error scenario testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] URL input with HTTPS validation working
- [ ] Network fetch handles all common error scenarios
- [ ] Checksum validation prevents tampered content
- [ ] CORS and security restrictions properly handled
- [ ] Remote packs cached and refreshable
- [ ] Privacy opt-in flow complete and clear
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages for all failure modes
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass

## Security Considerations
- Only HTTPS URLs allowed
- Certificate validation enforced
- Protection against redirect attacks
- Checksum validation prevents tampering
- Clear user consent for network access

## Notes
- Consider implementing pack update notifications
- URL validation should prevent obvious security issues
- Error messages should help troubleshoot network issues
- Cache refresh should be user-initiated, not automatic
