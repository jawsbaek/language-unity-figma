# Story 1.3: Rule Evaluation Engine

## Status: Ready

## Story
**As a** Plugin System  
**I want to** evaluate text content against loaded language pack rules  
**So that** I can identify terminology and style violations accurately

## Epic
Epic 1: Language Pack & Rule Engine (MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC3.1**: Engine supports string matching (preferred/aliases/forbidden terms)
   - Exact string matching for preferred terminology
   - Alias detection and suggestion of preferred terms
   - Forbidden term detection with severity levels

2. **AC3.2**: Regex-based style rules are properly evaluated
   - Support for JavaScript regex patterns
   - Pattern matching with capture groups
   - Context-aware replacements using captured groups

3. **AC3.3**: Severity levels (error/warning/info) are respected
   - Rules can specify severity: error, warning, or info
   - Severity affects UI display and filtering
   - Critical errors can block certain operations

4. **AC3.4**: Rule evaluation is performant for typical text volumes
   - Process text blocks (< 10KB) in under 100ms
   - Efficient regex compilation and caching
   - Memory usage scales linearly with text size

5. **AC3.5**: Multiple rule types can be applied to the same text
   - Rules are evaluated in priority order
   - Multiple issues can be flagged in the same text span
   - Rule conflicts are handled gracefully

## Priority
High - Core functionality

## Effort Estimate
8 story points

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1: Local language pack loading
- Language pack schema with rule definitions

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Design rule evaluation architecture
  - [ ] Define rule interface and data structures
  - [ ] Design evaluation pipeline
  - [ ] Plan rule priority and conflict resolution

- [ ] **Task 2**: Implement string matching engine
  - [ ] Exact string matching with case sensitivity options
  - [ ] Alias mapping and preferred term suggestions
  - [ ] Forbidden term detection with context

- [ ] **Task 3**: Build regex rule evaluation system
  - [ ] Regex compilation and caching
  - [ ] Pattern matching with capture groups
  - [ ] Replacement generation with captured content

- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement severity level handling
  - [ ] Severity enumeration (error/warning/info)
  - [ ] Rule categorization by severity
  - [ ] UI integration for severity-based filtering

- [ ] **Task 5**: Optimize performance
  - [ ] Rule compilation and caching
  - [ ] Text processing optimization
  - [ ] Memory usage profiling and optimization

- [ ] **Task 6**: Add comprehensive testing
  - [ ] Unit tests for each rule type
  - [ ] Performance benchmarking
  - [ ] Edge case and error handling tests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] String matching works for preferred/aliases/forbidden terms
- [ ] Regex rules evaluate correctly with capture groups
- [ ] Severity levels properly categorize and display issues
- [ ] Performance targets met (< 100ms for 10KB text)
- [ ] Multiple rules can be applied to same text
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Memory usage is efficient and predictable

## Technical Notes
- Consider using compiled regex for performance
- Rule evaluation should be stateless for parallelization
- Cache compiled rules to avoid recompilation
- Handle Unicode and international text correctly

## Test Cases
- Korean text with spacing rules
- English text with terminology preferences
- Mixed content with multiple rule types
- Large text blocks for performance testing
- Edge cases: empty text, special characters, formatting
