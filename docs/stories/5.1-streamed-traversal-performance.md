# Story 5.1: Streamed Traversal with Performance Targets

## Status: Ready

## Story
**As a** User working with large files  
**I want to** scan pages with many TEXT nodes without UI freezing  
**So that** I can maintain productivity while processing complex designs

## Epic
Epic 5: Performance & Reliability (MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1.1**: Page scans complete in < 2 seconds for typical files (≤5k TEXT nodes)
2. **AC1.2**: Traversal yields to main thread to prevent UI blocking
3. **AC1.3**: Progress indication shows scan completion status
4. **AC1.4**: Memory usage remains stable during large file processing
5. **AC1.5**: System remains responsive to user input during scans

## Priority
High - Performance critical

## Effort Estimate
8 story points

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance targets met (≤5k nodes in <2s)
- [ ] Non-blocking traversal implementation
- [ ] Progress indication working
- [ ] Stable memory usage
- [ ] UI responsiveness maintained
